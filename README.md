## Introduction :
   <div> This project is a dashboard website for a market located in Cairo that has multiple branches and deals with various companies. Its purpose is to assist data analysts in viewing their output in a simple manner for the owners and managers.</div>

## Aim :
   <div> After debating with data analysts, we found that they face two problems. The first is how to view and explain results to owners without requiring any technical skills. The second is how to collect and store data from different quarters in one place instead of having multiple Excel sheets.    
    We can solve the first problem by creating an interactive dashboard with simple charts to describe the data, allowing users to select what they want to view. They can select specific quarters, companies they deal with, or specific branches.  
    To solve the second problem, we will construct a database to save categories as tables with common relations to make the data more organized.</div>

## life Cycle :
   After data analyist finshed his work We take an Excel sheet and put it into a specific input on the website. Then, the server-side reads and saves the data in the database. After adding new data, it update response for this category, and send it to the dashboard, and handles the data with more flexibility and automatically updates dashboard.
